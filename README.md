## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get your first PyCppSQLJS program running.

1.  **Write your first program (hello_world.pcsj):**

    Create a file named `hello_world.pcsj` in the `examples/basic/` directory with the following content:

    ```python
    // examples/basic/hello_world.pcsj
    function main() {
        print("Hello, PyCppSQLJS!");
        var num = 10;
        if (num > 5) {
            print("Number is greater than 5");
        }
    }

    main();
    ```

2.  **Run the program:**

    Execute the program using the `run_dev.py` script:

    ```bash
    python scripts/run_dev.py --example examples/basic/hello_world.pcsj
    ```

    You should see the output:

    ```
    Hello, PyCppSQLJS!
    Number is greater than 5
    ```

3.  **Explore interactive mode:**

    You can also use the interactive interpreter to experiment with the language:

    ```bash
    python scripts/run_dev.py --interactive
    ```

    Then type PyCppSQLJS code directly:

    ```
    >>> var x = 10;
    >>> print(x * 2);
    20
    >>> from user in users where user.age > 30 select user.name;
    ```

## Syntax Highlights

PyCppSQLJS's syntax is designed for readability and power, combining familiar elements from Python, C++, SQL, and JavaScript into a cohesive whole. Here are some highlights demonstrating its unique blend:

```python
// A combined example showcasing PyCppSQLJS syntax

// 1. Module Import & Global Variable (Python/JS style)
import system.io as io;
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;

// 2. Class Definition with Types & Access Modifiers (C++/Python style)
class UserProfile {
    private string userId;
    public string username;
    public int age;
    private bool isActive;

    // Constructor with optional type annotations
    constructor(string userId, string username, int age) {
        this.userId = userId;
        this.username = username;
        this.age = age;
        this.isActive = true;
    }

    // Public method
    public async bool activateUser() {
        if (!this.isActive) {
            io.print("Activating user: " + this.username);
            // Simulate async operation (JS async/await style)
            await system.sleep(100);
            this.isActive = true;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Operator overloading (C++ style)
    operator + (UserProfile other) {
        return new UserProfile(
            this.userId + "_" + other.userId,
            this.username + "-" + other.username,
            (this.age + other.age) / 2
        );
    }
}

// 3. Functional Programming with List Comprehension (Python style)
function processUsers(userList: List<UserProfile>): List<string> {
    // Filter, map, and collect (functional style)
    var activeUsers = userList.filter(u => u.isActive && u.age > 18)
                              .map(u => u.username.toUpperCase());
    
    // List comprehension for a different transformation
    var seniorUserIds = [u.userId for u in userList if u.age >= 60];
    
    return activeUsers;
}

// 4. SQL-like Query for Data Manipulation
var userRecords = [
    { id: "u001", name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com", status: "active", score: 85 },
    { id: "u002", name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", status: "inactive", score: 92 },
    { id: "u003", name: "Charlie", email: "charlie@example.com", status: "active", score: 78 }
];

// Query active users with a score above 80, ordered by score
var highScoringActiveUsers = from user in userRecords
                             where user.status == "active" && user.score > 80
                             order by user.score desc
                             select { username: user.name, userEmail: user.email };

// 5. Error Handling (C++/Java/Python try-catch-finally style)
function safeDivide(a: int, b: int): int {
    try {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new DivisionByZeroError("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return a / b;
    } catch (DivisionByZeroError e) {
        io.print("Error: " + e.message);
        return 0;
    } finally {
        io.print("Division attempt finished.");
    }
}

// 6. Main execution block
function main() {
    var user1 = new UserProfile("abc", "Alice", 30);
    var user2 = new UserProfile("def", "Bob", 25);
    var user3 = user1 + user2; // Using overloaded operator
    
    io.print("Combined user: " + user3.username + ", Age: " + user3.age);
    user1.activateUser();

    var allUsers = List<UserProfile>();
    allUsers.add(user1);
    allUsers.add(user2);
    allUsers.add(user3);
    
    var processed = processUsers(allUsers);
    io.print("Processed users: " + processed.join(", "));

    io.print("High scoring active users:");
    for (user in highScoringActiveUsers) {
        io.print("  " + user.username + " (" + user.userEmail + ")");
    }

    safeDivide(10, 2);
    safeDivide(10, 0);
}

main();
```

## Language Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Clean, readable syntax inspired by Python
   - Minimal boilerplate code
   - Intuitive operator precedence
   - Consistent naming conventions

2. **Performance by Design**
   - Zero-cost abstractions where possible
   - Efficient memory management
   - Optimized data structures
   - Smart compilation strategies

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Helpful error messages
   - Rich IDE support
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Built-in debugging tools

### Type System

PyCppSQLJS features a hybrid type system that combines the best of static and dynamic typing:

```python
// Dynamic typing (default)
var name = "John";
var age = 25;

// Static typing (optional)
string name: "John";
int age: 25;

// Type inference
var numbers = [1, 2, 3];  // Inferred as int[]
var mixed = [1, "two", 3.0];  // Inferred as (int | string | float)[]

// Union types
var id: string | int = "user123";
id = 123;  // Also valid

// Generic types
class Container<T> {
    private T value;
    
    constructor(T value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    
    public T get() {
        return this.value;
    }
}

// Type constraints
function sort<T: Comparable>(items: T[]): T[] {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Memory Management

The language implements a hybrid memory management system:

1. **Reference Counting**
   - Automatic memory management for most objects
   - Zero overhead for simple cases
   - Thread-safe reference counting

2. **Manual Control**
   - Optional manual memory management for performance-critical code
   - Smart pointers for safe manual memory management
   - RAII principles for resource management

```python
// Automatic memory management
class Resource {
    private string name;
    
    constructor(string name) {
        this.name = name;
        print("Resource created:", name);
    }
    
    ~destructor() {
        print("Resource cleaned up:", name);
    }
}

// Manual memory management
class PerformanceCritical {
    private raw_ptr data;
    
    constructor() {
        this.data = allocate(1024);  // Manual allocation
    }
    
    ~destructor() {
        deallocate(this.data);  // Manual deallocation
    }
}

// Smart pointers
var ptr = make_unique<Resource>("temp");
var shared = make_shared<Resource>("shared");
```

### Concurrency Model

PyCppSQLJS provides multiple concurrency models:

1. **Async/Await**
```python
async function processData() {
    var data = await fetchData();
    var processed = await processInBackground(data);
    return await saveToDatabase(processed);
}

// Parallel execution
async function processAll(items) {
    var tasks = items.map(item => processItem(item));
    var results = await Promise.all(tasks);
    return results;
}
```

2. **Threads**
```python
// Thread creation
var thread = new Thread(() => {
    // Thread code
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        processItem(i);
    }
});

// Thread synchronization
class ThreadSafeCounter {
    private atomic int count = 0;
    
    public void increment() {
        atomic {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Actors**
```python
actor Database {
    private var connection;
    
    async function query(string sql) {
        // Handle database queries
        return await connection.execute(sql);
    }
    
    async function transaction(callback) {
        await connection.beginTransaction();
        try {
            var result = await callback();
            await connection.commit();
            return result;
        } catch (error) {
            await connection.rollback();
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```

### Standard Library

The language comes with a rich standard library:

1. **Collections**
```python
// Lists
var numbers = List<int>();
numbers.add(1);
numbers.addAll([2, 3, 4]);

// Maps
var config = Map<string, any>();
config.set("port", 8080);
config.set("debug", true);

// Sets
var unique = Set<string>();
unique.add("apple");
unique.add("banana");

// Queues
var queue = Queue<Request>();
queue.enqueue(new Request("GET", "/api"));
var request = queue.dequeue();
```

2. **I/O Operations**
```python
// File operations
async function readFile(path: string): string {
    var file = await File.open(path);
    var content = await file.readAll();
    await file.close();
    return content;
}

// Network operations
async function fetchData(url: string): any {
    var client = new HttpClient();
    var response = await client.get(url);
    return await response.json();
}

// Stream processing
async function processLargeFile(path: string) {
    var stream = File.openStream(path);
    for await (var chunk in stream) {
        await processChunk(chunk);
    }
}
```

3. **Data Processing**
```python
// SQL-like operations
var result = from user in users
            where user.age > 18
            group by user.city
            having count() > 5
            select {
                city: key,
                count: count(),
                avgAge: avg(user.age)
            };

// Data transformation
var pipeline = Pipeline.from(users)
    .filter(user => user.active)
    .map(user => user.name)
    .distinct()
    .collect();

// JSON processing
var data = JSON.parse('{"name": "John", "age": 30}');
var name = data.get("name");
var age = data.get("age");
```

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling system:

```python
// Custom error types
class ValidationError extends Error {
    constructor(string message, var details) {
        super(message);
        this.details = details;
    }
}

// Error handling patterns
function validateUser(user) {
    if (!user.name) {
        throw new ValidationError("Name is required", {
            field: "name",
            code: "REQUIRED"
        });
    }
    
    if (user.age < 0) {
        throw new ValidationError("Age must be positive", {
            field: "age",
            code: "INVALID_RANGE"
        });
    }
}

// Error recovery
async function processUser(user) {
    try {
        await validateUser(user);
        await saveUser(user);
    } catch (ValidationError e) {
        log.warning("Validation failed:", e.details);
        return { success: false, errors: e.details };
    } catch (DatabaseError e) {
        log.error("Database error:", e);
        throw new ApplicationError("Failed to save user", e);
    } finally {
        await cleanup();
    }
}
```

### Metaprogramming

Powerful metaprogramming capabilities:

```python
// Decorators
@log
@cache
function expensiveOperation(x: int): int {
    // Implementation
}

// Reflection
function inspectObject(obj: any) {
    var methods = reflect.getMethods(obj);
    var properties = reflect.getProperties(obj);
    var annotations = reflect.getAnnotations(obj);
    
    return {
        methods,
        properties,
        annotations
    };
}

// Code generation
@generate
class DataModel {
    @field
    string name;
    
    @field
    int age;
    
    // Generated methods:
    // - constructor
    // - getters/setters
    // - toString
    // - equals/hashCode
}
```

### Testing Framework

Built-in testing support:

```python
// Unit tests
test "addition works correctly" {
    assert 1 + 1 == 2;
    assert 2 + 2 == 4;
}

// Property-based testing
property "addition is commutative" {
    forall (a: int, b: int) {
        assert a + b == b + a;
    }
}

// Integration tests
test "user registration flow" {
    var user = new User("test", "pass");
    await user.register();
    assert user.isRegistered();
    
    var login = await user.login();
    assert login.success;
}

// Performance tests
benchmark "sorting algorithm" {
    var data = generateRandomData(1000);
    measure {
        sort(data);
    }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

PyCppSQLJS is designed with performance in mind:

1. **Lexical Analysis**: Efficient token scanning with minimal memory allocation
2. **Parsing**: Predictive parsing for fast syntax analysis
3. **Runtime**: Optimized bytecode execution
4. **Memory Management**: Smart memory management with reference counting
5. **Type System**: Runtime type checking with performance optimizations

## Benchmarking and Performance

PyCppSQLJS is designed with performance as a core tenet, aiming to deliver execution speeds comparable to compiled languages where it matters most, while retaining the flexibility of dynamic languages. Our benchmarking efforts focus on ensuring efficient operations across various domains.

### Methodology

Our performance benchmarks are conducted using a controlled environment to ensure consistent and reliable results. Key aspects of our methodology include:

-   **Reproducibility**: Scripts and data used for benchmarks are open-source and easily reproducible.
-   **Isolation**: Benchmarks are run in isolated environments to minimize external interference.
-   **Variety of Workloads**: We test against a diverse set of workloads, including CPU-bound computations, I/O-bound operations, data processing tasks, and typical application scenarios.
-   **Comparison**: Where relevant, PyCppSQLJS performance is compared against its foundational languages (Python, C++, JavaScript) and other similar languages to provide context.

### Key Performance Areas

1.  **Lexical Analysis & Parsing**: Highly optimized for fast processing of source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
2.  **Runtime Execution**: Continuous improvements to the interpreter and planned JIT compilation target faster execution of user code.
3.  **Memory Efficiency**: Smart memory management strategies reduce overhead and improve cache locality.
4.  **Concurrency**: Benchmarks for `async/await`, threads, and actor models demonstrate efficient handling of concurrent operations.
5.  **Data Operations**: Performance testing of SQL-like queries and data transformation pipelines on large datasets.

### Running Benchmarks

You can run the included benchmarks yourself using the development script:

```bash
python scripts/run_dev.py --example examples/benchmarks/fibonacci.pcsj
# Or to run all benchmarks
# python scripts/run_dev.py --benchmark-all # (Future feature)
```

Detailed benchmark results and analysis will be provided in the `docs/benchmarks/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while working with PyCppSQLJS.

### Installation and Environment Issues

**Issue: `python: command not found` or `python3: command not found`**

*   **Solution**: Ensure Python is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH. On Windows, verify the installation options for adding Python to PATH during setup. On Unix-like systems, you might need to use `python3` explicitly or create a symlink if `python` points to an older version.

**Issue: `pip` command not found**

*   **Solution**: `pip` usually comes with Python. If it's missing, you might need to reinstall Python or manually install `pip`. Ensure your Python installation is complete.

**Issue: `virtualenv` not found or issues with `venv` activation**

*   **Solution**: Make sure you have `virtualenv` installed (`pip install virtualenv`) or that you are using the built-in `venv` module correctly. Double-check the activation command for your operating system (`venv\Scripts\activate` for Windows, `source venv/bin/activate` for Unix/MacOS).

**Issue: `ModuleNotFoundError` for PyCppSQLJS components (e.g., `src.lexer`)**

*   **Solution**: This often happens if the `src` directory is not correctly recognized as a Python package or if your Python path is not set up. Ensure your virtual environment is active and you are running scripts from the project root. The `__init__.py` files in `src/` and `src/lexer/` are crucial for Python to treat these as packages.

### Running Scripts and Examples

**Issue: `Permission denied` when running `scripts/run_dev.py`**

*   **Solution**: On Unix-like systems, ensure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/run_dev.py`. On Windows, you should run it directly with `python scripts/run_dev.py`.

**Issue: Example file not found when using `--example`**

*   **Solution**: Verify the path to the example file. It should be relative to the project root (e.g., `examples/basic/hello_world.pcsj`). Check for typos in the filename or path.

### Development and Contribution

**Issue: Linter errors (`flake8`, `mypy`) or formatting issues (`black`) after making changes**

*   **Solution**: Run the provided development scripts to automatically format and lint your code before committing: `python scripts/run_dev.py --format` and `python scripts/run_dev.py --lint`. Address any remaining errors reported by the linters manually.

**Issue: Tests failing unexpectedly**

*   **Solution**: Run tests with verbose output (`pytest tests/test_lexer.py -v`) to see detailed error messages. Review your changes carefully, especially if they affect existing functionality. If you believe the test is incorrect, discuss it in a GitHub issue.

**Issue: Git issues (e.g., merge conflicts, push failures)**

*   **Solution**: Familiarize yourself with basic Git commands. For merge conflicts, `git status` will show you the conflicted files, and you'll need to manually resolve them. Ensure you have the latest changes from the `main` branch before starting new work or pushing: `git pull origin main`.

If your issue is not listed here or the solutions don't work, please refer to the [Community and Support](#community-and-support) section for how to get further assistance.

## Glossary

To help you better understand PyCppSQLJS and its components, here's a glossary of key terms:

-   **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code, where each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.
-   **Lexer (Lexical Analyzer)**: The first phase of a compiler/interpreter that converts a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens.
-   **Parser**: The component that takes the stream of tokens from the lexer and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), ensuring the code adheres to the language's grammar.
-   **Interpreter**: A program that directly executes instructions written in a programming language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine-language program.
-   **Runtime Environment**: The state of a computer while a program is running, providing services such as memory management, process scheduling, and I/O handling.
-   **Token**: A unit of source code recognized by the lexer, representing keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, etc.
-   **Type System**: A set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules.
-   **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**: A method of compiling computer code during execution of a program (at run time) rather than before execution.
-   **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**: A mechanism by which a program written in one programming language can call routines or make use of services written in another.
-   **WebAssembly (WASM)**: A binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine, designed as a portable compilation target for high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
-   **Module**: A self-contained unit of code that can be imported and reused in other parts of a program.
-   **Decorator**: A design pattern used in PyCppSQLJS (and Python) to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or classes without directly changing their source code.
-   **Metaprogramming**: The ability of a program to treat other programs as its data. It means a program can be written to read, generate, analyze, or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
